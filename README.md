# SimpleDNS Installer

This repository contains the **public installer** used to install the private SimpleDNS server.

The actual SimpleDNS codebase is stored in a **private repo**, so authentication is required.  
This installer process generates an SSH deploy key for the server, allows you to add it to GitHub,  
and then completes installation automatically.
